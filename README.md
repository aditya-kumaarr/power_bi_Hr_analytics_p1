# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD (Live Dashboard creation using Power Bi)
## Project Objective
The objective of this HR Analytics dashboard is to analyze employee attrition and understand the factors that contribute to it. This includes examining patterns and trends in attrition across various dimensions such as age group, salary slabs, education fields, job roles, and gender. Key KPIs like Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Salary, and Average Tenure are tracked to identify high-risk segments and support strategic HR decisions. The insights derived aim to help organizations reduce employee turnover, improve workforce planning, and enhance employee retention strategies.

## Project Insight
- Overall Attrition Rate: The dashboard shows an attrition rate of 16.1%, indicating that a noticeable proportion of employees are leaving the organization.
- Gender-wise Attrition: Female employees have a slightly higher attrition count than males. This could point toward a need to explore gender-based engagement or policy reviews.
-	Age Factor: The majority of employees who left were between 26 to 35 years old, which suggests mid-career professionals may be more likely to resign, possibly for better opportunities or dissatisfaction.
-	Job Role Influence: Job roles like Sales Representative and Laboratory Technician contribute significantly to overall attrition. These roles might be facing issues like burnout, workload, or limited growth.
-	Marital Status: Single employees show a noticeably higher attrition rate compared to married employees. This could be due to increased job-hopping among early-career individuals or lifestyle flexibility.
-	Monthly Income Impact: A large portion of attrition appears to occur in employees with monthly income between 2,000 and 5,000, suggesting salary dissatisfaction could be a factor.
-	Distance from Home: Employees living closer to the workplace (0â€“10 km) surprisingly had higher attrition counts. This could indicate issues unrelated to commute, like culture fit or management concerns.
-	Departmental Breakdown: The Research & Development department had the highest number of resignations. This could warrant deeper analysis into project loads, management style, or development opportunities.

## Final Conclusion:
To improve the sales of Vrinda Store, a strategic marketing plan focused on women aged 30-49 years residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh should be implemented. This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant household and lifestyle purchases. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
